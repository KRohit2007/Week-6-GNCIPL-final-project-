Final group project EDA part processed and worked on 
🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focused on understanding the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset to prepare for modeling.

Key Steps:

Data Overview

Loaded the dataset and inspected data types, column information, and summary statistics.

Checked for missing values and data completeness across features.

Univariate Analysis

Numerical Variables: Visualized distributions using histograms to identify skewness and outliers.

Categorical Variables: Used count plots to explore frequency distributions for columns such as region, sex, smoker, and insuranceclaim.

Bivariate Analysis

Explored relationships between numerical features through a correlation heatmap, identifying strong correlations and potential predictors.

Analyzed how categorical variables (e.g., smoking status, region) impact numerical outcomes.

Insights

Certain demographic and behavioral factors showed clear patterns related to claims and potential fraud indicators.

Minimal missing data, ensuring readiness for preprocessing and feature engineering.
